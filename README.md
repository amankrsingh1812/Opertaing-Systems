## Operating Systems
Developed and experimented with parts of an Operating Systems kernel (xv6).

### System Calls
* Analysed PC's power-on bootstrap procedure
* Created new system calls and tested them using a user-level application 
### Process Management
* Implement a job scheduler that uses a hybrid of the shortest job first + weighted Round Robin algorithm
* Created several test cases for testing the scheduler
### Memory Management
* Lazy Memory Allocation - Modified the kernel to handle page faults and added code for allocation of new pages
* Paging - Implemented kernel process to handle swap-in and swap-out mechanism. LRU policy was used.
### File Management
* Compared Compression and Encryption features of the ZFS filesystems through workloads created using vdbench.
